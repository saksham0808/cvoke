cvoke - Command-Invoke
======================

An npm-cli utility to allow you to stash commonly used shell command templates for later use, with variables. Useful for say API testing with varying parameters. No more searching in your history to find that test command you ran ages ago.

Still under development, no variables support yet and some commands might not work.

`cvoke new <invoke-name>`

`cvoke wake <invoke-name>`
